Reconstruction of the roadway requires installation of a culvert within San Pablo Creek, backfilled with engineered fill, to buttress the landslide and provide a stabilized footing for the roadway embankment. An offsite mitigation area is included as part of the project.

All components of Travel Safe Richmond are working together to create unified policies and infrastructure recommendations for improving roadway conditions throughout the City of Richmond. Input from City stakeholders and community members is a critical component of this effort. Components of Travel Safe Richmond The two components of the Travel Safe Richmond project include: Local Roadway Safety Plan Traffic safety impacts the health and comfort of all those who live and travel in the City of Richmond. The Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) will identify traffic safety trends, and develop a program for the funding and implementation of improvements. The implementation of this plan is a step towards making the transportation system safe and more equitable for users of all transportation modes. The LRSP’s primary goals include: Reduce fatal and serious injury collisions Ensure equitable traffic safety investments in the neighborhoods that need them most Support safe travel for people walking and biking, especially near schools and other high-demand areas Encourage safe driving, through roadway design and outreach Prepare for the future with climate-resilient transportation safety infrastructure The Local Roadway Safety Plan was approved by the City Council on July 19, 2023. LRSP\\'s Adoption Consideration: July 19, 2023 Adopted Resolution No. 105-22 and Final Local Roadway Safety Plan (/DocumentCenter/View/65001/105-22-CC-reso-Local-Roadway-Safety-Plan---CONFORMED---Adopted-7-19-22) Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan The Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan (BPAP) will serve as the blueprint for improving walking and bicycling conditions in the City of Richmond for the next five years. This Plan will consolidate recommendations from the Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) and coordinate with other Richmond planning efforts to provide near-term bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure recommendations. The proposed improvements will make it safer, easier, and more practical to walk, bike, roll and access transit throughout the City of Richmond. Goals for the B/P Action Plan include: Develop a recommended bicycle and pedestrian network that builds on Richmond\\'s existing assets and focuses on closing existing gaps Develop a list of near-term (1-3 year) infrastructure projects focusing on bicycle and pedestrian safety and comfort Develop an implementation strategy that identifies potential funding opportunities and applies those to each project Develop a general set of guidelines for the development and implementation of bicycle facilities and off-street paths The Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan had a study session on October 25, 2022 and was adopted by City Council on February 7, 2023. BPAP\\'s City Council Adoption Consideration: February 7, 2023 Adopted Resolution No. 9-23 and Final Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan (/DocumentCenter/View/65000/9-23-CC-reso-Bicycle-and-Pedestrian-Action-Plan---CONFORMED---Adopted-2-7-2023) Project Timeline The project was developed in two distinct phases as noted in the graphic below. Travel Safe Richmond Community Workshops Throughout the development of Travel Safe Richmond, the City organized a number of events and digital opportunities, including community workshops/open houses, pop up events, and presenting to the business community and at several neighborhood council meetings to gather the public\\'s feedback and ideas. All two components of the Project will coordinate their community engagement into one unified process. 1st Community Workshop: December 8, 2021 Presentation (/DocumentCenter/View/65002/TSR_Workshop1_Presentation_12082021) 2nd Community Workshop: May 18, 2022 ( In person ) Flyer (/DocumentCenter/View/65003/Flyer_MayWorkshop_033022r) 3rd Community Workshop: November 9, 2022 Presentation (/DocumentCenter/View/65004/TSR_Workshop-3_DRAFT110722) Contact Us If you have any comments or questions about the project, you can reach project planer, Lydia Elias at travelsafe@ci.richmond.ca.us (mailto:travelsafe@ci.richmond.ca.us) .     inner column   inner row  outer column   outer row                   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) (/4336/Accessory-Dwelling-Units-ADUs)      Architectural Heritage Guidelines (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/3525)      Boards & Commissions (/2861/Boards-Commissions)       Design Review Board      Historic Preservation Commission       Historic Preservation Awards        Planning Commission        Cannabis Business Information (/3603/Cannabis-Business-Information)      City Fact Sheet (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=8348)      Fees/Forms/Checklists (/2102/FeesFormsChecklists)      Form Based Code (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/2965/RLC-FBC)      General Plan 2030 (/2608/General-Plan-2030)      Hilltop Horizon Specific Plan (https://hilltophorizon.com/)      Historical Point Molate Project Information (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/270/Point-Molate)      Mapping Services (/3344/Mapping-Services)      Printable Maps (/290)      Project Information (/2860/Project-Information)       Additional Projects      Environmental Documents      General Plan Updates       About -

The Richmond-Ohlone Greenway Gap Closure Project represents the third phase of the Richmond Greenway Project, which would provide a continuous bicycle and pedestrian pathway in Richmond from Garrard Boulevard and the Richmond Parkway to San Pablo Avenue. The Richmond Greenway would connect the San Francisco Bay Trail at the west with the Ohlone Greenway in the City of El Cerrito at the east. The proposed project includes installation of the new multi-use trail, a new crosswalk and traffic signal on San Pablo Avenue, and a new bridge over realigned Baxter Creek as well as associated improvements and landscaping.   Environmental Review  An Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared for this project and is available\\xa0below. The basis for proposing a Mitigated Negative Declaration was the finding that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, implementation of proposed mitigation measures will reduce all impacts to a less-than-significant level. Written comments on the Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration, via hard copy or electronic mail, must be received on or before 5:00 PM on Monday,\\xa0June 27, 2011 at the following address:  Lina Velasco, Senior Planner City of Richmond Planning Division 450 Civic Center Plaza, Second Floor Richmond, CA 94804    (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248) Final Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration  (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248)  Notice of Availability of a Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248)  (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=7201)  CEQA Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=7201)       inner column   inner row  outer column   outer row                   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) (/4336/Accessory-Dwelling-Units-ADUs)      Architectural Heritage Guidelines (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/3525)      Boards & Commissions (/2861/Boards-Commissions)       Design Review Board      Historic Preservation Commission       Historic Preservation Awards        Planning Commission        Cannabis Business Information (/3603/Cannabis-Business-Information)      City Fact Sheet (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=8348)      Fees/Forms/Checklists (/2102/FeesFormsChecklists)      Form Based Code (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/2965/RLC-FBC)      General Plan 2030 (/2608/General-Plan-2030)      Hilltop Horizon Specific Plan (https://hilltophorizon.com/)      Historical Point Molate Project Information (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/270/Point-Molate)      Mapping Services (/3344/Mapping-Services)      Printable Maps (/290)      Project Information (/2860/Project-Information)       Additional Projects      Environmental Documents      General Plan Updates       About -

Mathieu Court Alley, at the corner of Barrett Avenue  To learn more about the Play Everywhere Challenge, please visit http://kaboom.org/playeverywhere (https://kaboom.org/playability/play_everywhere) .

The project partners will host a design charrette to develop ideas for the play street, & then work with artists, local non-profits, & volunteers to implement the improvements.  Project partners will select 1-2 Lead Artists with public art & community engagement experience from the RAC\\'s roster of experienced teaching artists. Through RAC\\'s Artists in Schools & Arts in the Community Program, the partners will work with two local elementary schools & youth of the Nevin Community Center to develop and implement portions of the project. In addition to the work done by K-6th grade students in after school programs, the project lead artists will hold 3-4 community work days in which community members & families of student artists can help install the fence art work & complete the asphalt painting.  The improvements contemplated include games painted on the ground, a game that will be displayed as fence art, stepping stones for balancing, blackboards for drawing, boulders for seating, community garden boxes with seating areas & interactive educational signs about the green features of the alley, nutrition, and healthy living. Other improvements include a trash & recycling receptacle, a safety barrier that can be closed when families are playing, & gateway fencing for the play street. The themes of the games will focus on sustainability, nutrition, & healthy living. The games & signage proposed will be in English and Spanish to encourage use of this play street by non-English speaking area residents. Prior to the green alley improvements, this alley was a source of blight for this community. This project will make play a priority in the alley versus vehicle travel and will help create community ownership of the alley to ensure its longevity as a community asset.  The creation of an attractive neighborhood green & play space will reduce the need for vehicle trips to have opportunities for play and to be physically active in a park-deficient neighborhood. It will also encourage and support the use and enjoyment of outdoor space, enhancing the community & promoting public health.   Mathieu Court Alley Play Street Selected as One of the 50 Winners Nationwide in the Play Everywhere Challenge  Earlier this summer, the City of Richmond partnered with the Richmond Art Center, Trust for Public Land, Richmond Love Your Block Initiative, and the Iron Triangle Neighborhood Council to submit a concept to paint interactive games & artwork on Mathieu Court Alley, a recently transformed \"green alley\". The idea is to add opportunities for play where families can have a fun, green, and clean place to play within the alley in this park-deficient neighborhood. In August, this project was selected as a finalist to submit a full grant application and on Tuesday, September 20th, the project was selected as one of the 50 winners, out of the 1000 plus applications submitted nationwide. The project implementation is expected to begin in November, beginning with a design charrette with area schools and residents in October.

Working with the community to green this 16,000 square foot paved surface will promote a healthy community by reclaiming this space as a usable neighborhood amenity, and help deter undesirable activities that occur there now. Residents and community partners will not only be involved in the designing of the space, but also in the construction activities through part-time employment and volunteer opportunities.     The project will replace 16,000 square feet of impervious paving with landscaped areas, and with pervious pavers and/or turf cell where vehicle access is necessary. Incorporating bioswales and/or rain gardens, and native planting, the project will mimic natural systems that clean and filter stormwater, recharge groundwater, and create habitat for native birds and beneficial insects. It will create a new community green space with tree canopy (possibly fruit or nut trees), community garden opportunities, and landscaped informal seating areas. Community gardens and edible landscape will create a source of fresh produce in a “food desert” neighborhood. Limiting vehicle access will allow for more shared use of the entire space, with opportunities for children to play safely, as well as providing a safe route of travel.    The greening of Mathieu Court will decrease air and water pollution by filtering stormwater, mitigating runoff, and providing tree canopy. The additional tree canopy and landscape area will also reduce heat island effect, mitigating effects of climate change. The existing asphalt paving can be recycled and incorporated into underlying base material for areas of pervious paving, thus limiting consumption of natural resources. Creation of an attractive neighborhood green will reduce the need for vehicle trips to get to an open space in this park-deficient neighborhood. It will also encourage and support the use and enjoyment of outdoor space, enhancing the community and promoting public health.

The proposed improvements include construction of a new diversion box, pump station, pipeline, and an above ground, circular, pre-stressed concrete tank with storage volume of approximately 5 million gallons. The tank will be approximately 150 feet in diameter and approximately 53 feet tall. Water Pollution Control Plant effluent will be used to supply water to the wash down system used to clean the tank. The tank will be covered to contain odors. The project site is located at 601 Canal Boulevard in the City of Richmond.

The Modernization Project also includes related infrastructure improvements to Facility piping, utility lines, and electrical systems. The Modernization Project includes several integral equipment components that would reduce air emissions from Facility operations (the Emission Reduction Project Components) and further Project Design Features proposed to avoid or minimize environmental impacts. The Project also includes a new Reliability Program, including new safety programs and several physical modifications including the replacement of 17 piping circuits in the Crude Unit. Reducing Project emissions would help meet Chevron\\'s commitment of assuring that the Project would cause no net increase in emissions of criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and public health risks from air pollutants, when compared to the Facility emissions and operations that occurred during the baseline period of 2008 through 2010. Following issuance of all necessary approvals, Chevron proposes to complete Project construction within approximately 24 months. The City Council approved the Modernization Project on July 29, 2014.

The school would increase student enrollment in grades 5 through 12 from approximately 800 to a maximum enrollment of 2,050, and increase the number of staff from 70 to 300. In addition to renovations to the existing three classroom buildings, the project would demolish approximately 165,387 square feet of existing one- and two-story commercial buildings on six parcels and construct three new classroom buildings and two new gymnasiums. Overall proposed development includes 208,986 gross square feet of new buildings, outdoor physical recreation areas (i.e., playing and sports fields, play structures and ball courts, recess yards), new landscaping and trees throughout the site, and associated parking and infrastructure improvements. The project also involves consolidation of the eight existing parcels that make up the site into three parcels and the abandonment of Technology Court. The new school campus would be configured with two distinct campuses to house middle and high school programs.

The project site is bound by and immediately adjacent to the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad (AT&SF) to the west, the Richmond Country Club to the east and north, and Giant Road and single-family homes to the south. The project applicant is proposing a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change to the RL-2, Single Family Low Density Residential District and OS, Open Space District, and a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (TTM) to allow the development of 94 single-family homes. The development of the proposed project would require re-configuration of a portion of the golf course and the removal of existing mature eucalyptus trees within the project site boundaries and adjacent to the golf course. The proposed single-family homes would be a mixture of 1- and 2-stories with a maximum building height of 25 feet.

At least 10 percent of the proposed new housing units would be affordable to moderate-income households. The project site is comprised of three parcels: two contiguous parcels located west of Napa Street and a separate parcel located east of Napa Street. There is existing residential development on the west side of Napa Street. This development would remain and is not part of the proposed project. The three-story townhome-style condominiums with traditional architecture would be developed in 15 buildings ranging from triplexes to eight-plexes, separated by landscaped paseos and common open space.

Project Description   The Point Molate Mixed Use Project (Project) proposes a mixed-use community that would include the following components:\\xa0 open space, adaptive re-use of the historic cottages, adaptive re-use of the historic Winehaven buildings, and residential development.   The Modified Project proposes a mixed-use community that would include the following components:   Approximately 1,260 newly constructed residential units.  Approximately 374,572 square feet of rehabilitated existing structures and 250,000 square feet of new construction for mixed-use development that could include restaurant, retail, commercial, and/or residential uses.  Approximately 10,000 square feet for an onsite joint fire and police substation and/or other community service uses.  At least 70 percent of the total above-water Project Site area (approximately 193.06 acres) would remain as open space, including recreational areas, parks, trails (including an approximately 1.5-mile portion of the San Francisco Bay Trail along the shoreline), vista overlooks, and other similar spaces that are open to the public.  A terminal on the existing pier that may be accessible to water transit options, such as ferries, water shuttles, and/or water taxis.  New roads to serve the development within the Project Site; additionally, widening Stenmark Drive from the Project Site to I-580 Ramps.

Reconstruction of the roadway requires installation of a culvert within San Pablo Creek, backfilled with engineered fill, to buttress the landslide and provide a stabilized footing for the roadway embankment. An offsite mitigation area is included as part of the project.

All components of Travel Safe Richmond are working together to create unified policies and infrastructure recommendations for improving roadway conditions throughout the City of Richmond. Input from City stakeholders and community members is a critical component of this effort. Components of Travel Safe Richmond The two components of the Travel Safe Richmond project include: Local Roadway Safety Plan Traffic safety impacts the health and comfort of all those who live and travel in the City of Richmond. The Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) will identify traffic safety trends, and develop a program for the funding and implementation of improvements. The implementation of this plan is a step towards making the transportation system safe and more equitable for users of all transportation modes. The LRSP’s primary goals include: Reduce fatal and serious injury collisions Ensure equitable traffic safety investments in the neighborhoods that need them most Support safe travel for people walking and biking, especially near schools and other high-demand areas Encourage safe driving, through roadway design and outreach Prepare for the future with climate-resilient transportation safety infrastructure The Local Roadway Safety Plan was approved by the City Council on July 19, 2023. LRSP's Adoption Consideration: July 19, 2023 Adopted Resolution No. 105-22 and Final Local Roadway Safety Plan (/DocumentCenter/View/65001/105-22-CC-reso-Local-Roadway-Safety-Plan---CONFORMED---Adopted-7-19-22) Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan The Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan (BPAP) will serve as the blueprint for improving walking and bicycling conditions in the City of Richmond for the next five years. This Plan will consolidate recommendations from the Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) and coordinate with other Richmond planning efforts to provide near-term bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure recommendations. The proposed improvements will make it safer, easier, and more practical to walk, bike, roll and access transit throughout the City of Richmond. Goals for the B/P Action Plan include: Develop a recommended bicycle and pedestrian network that builds on Richmond's existing assets and focuses on closing existing gaps Develop a list of near-term (1-3 year) infrastructure projects focusing on bicycle and pedestrian safety and comfort Develop an implementation strategy that identifies potential funding opportunities and applies those to each project Develop a general set of guidelines for the development and implementation of bicycle facilities and off-street paths The Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan had a study session on October 25, 2022 and was adopted by City Council on February 7, 2023. BPAP's City Council Adoption Consideration: February 7, 2023 Adopted Resolution No. 9-23 and Final Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan (/DocumentCenter/View/65000/9-23-CC-reso-Bicycle-and-Pedestrian-Action-Plan---CONFORMED---Adopted-2-7-2023) Project Timeline The project was developed in two distinct phases as noted in the graphic below. Travel Safe Richmond Community Workshops Throughout the development of Travel Safe Richmond, the City organized a number of events and digital opportunities, including community workshops/open houses, pop up events, and presenting to the business community and at several neighborhood council meetings to gather the public's feedback and ideas. All two components of the Project will coordinate their community engagement into one unified process. 1st Community Workshop: December 8, 2021 Presentation (/DocumentCenter/View/65002/TSR_Workshop1_Presentation_12082021) 2nd Community Workshop: May 18, 2022 ( In person ) Flyer (/DocumentCenter/View/65003/Flyer_MayWorkshop_033022r) 3rd Community Workshop: November 9, 2022 Presentation (/DocumentCenter/View/65004/TSR_Workshop-3_DRAFT110722) Contact Us If you have any comments or questions about the project, you can reach project planer, Lydia Elias at travelsafe@ci.richmond.ca.us (mailto:travelsafe@ci.richmond.ca.us) .     inner column   inner row  outer column   outer row                   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) (/4336/Accessory-Dwelling-Units-ADUs)      Architectural Heritage Guidelines (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/3525)      Boards & Commissions (/2861/Boards-Commissions)       Design Review Board      Historic Preservation Commission       Historic Preservation Awards        Planning Commission        Cannabis Business Information (/3603/Cannabis-Business-Information)      City Fact Sheet (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=8348)      Fees/Forms/Checklists (/2102/FeesFormsChecklists)      Form Based Code (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/2965/RLC-FBC)      General Plan 2030 (/2608/General-Plan-2030)      Hilltop Horizon Specific Plan (https://hilltophorizon.com/)      Historical Point Molate Project Information (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/270/Point-Molate)      Mapping Services (/3344/Mapping-Services)      Printable Maps (/290)      Project Information (/2860/Project-Information)       Additional Projects      Environmental Documents      General Plan Updates       About -

Project Description   The proposed project is located on a 42.14 acre site at 2995 Atlas Road, at the corner of Atlas and Giant Road. The project involves construction of a  700,000 square foot logistics building and associated parking, loading, and landscaping. The new building would include 40,000 square feet of office space and 687,820 square feet of warehouse space.  The height of the building would vary from 40 to 45 feet, and its length would be 1,506 feet. The site previously included two manufacturing buildings and one office building totaling approximately 593,500 square feet. The footprint of the new building would be similar as that of the previous structures. A  total of 427 vehicle parking spaces and 105 bicycles stalls are proposed for employees. Drive alsles on the site are proposed to be 25 and 30 feet wide for the employee parking area and the truck access area.

The Richmond-Ohlone Greenway Gap Closure Project represents the third phase of the Richmond Greenway Project, which would provide a continuous bicycle and pedestrian pathway in Richmond from Garrard Boulevard and the Richmond Parkway to San Pablo Avenue. The Richmond Greenway would connect the San Francisco Bay Trail at the west with the Ohlone Greenway in the City of El Cerrito at the east. The proposed project includes installation of the new multi-use trail, a new crosswalk and traffic signal on San Pablo Avenue, and a new bridge over realigned Baxter Creek as well as associated improvements and landscaping.   Environmental Review  An Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared for this project and is available below. The basis for proposing a Mitigated Negative Declaration was the finding that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, implementation of proposed mitigation measures will reduce all impacts to a less-than-significant level. Written comments on the Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration, via hard copy or electronic mail, must be received on or before 5:00 PM on Monday, June 27, 2011 at the following address:  Lina Velasco, Senior Planner City of Richmond Planning Division 450 Civic Center Plaza, Second Floor Richmond, CA 94804    (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248) Final Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration  (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248)  Notice of Availability of a Draft Mitigated Negative Declaration (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/27248)  (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=7201)  CEQA Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=7201)       inner column   inner row  outer column   outer row                   Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) (/4336/Accessory-Dwelling-Units-ADUs)      Architectural Heritage Guidelines (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/3525)      Boards & Commissions (/2861/Boards-Commissions)       Design Review Board      Historic Preservation Commission       Historic Preservation Awards        Planning Commission        Cannabis Business Information (/3603/Cannabis-Business-Information)      City Fact Sheet (/DocumentView.aspx?DID=8348)      Fees/Forms/Checklists (/2102/FeesFormsChecklists)      Form Based Code (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/2965/RLC-FBC)      General Plan 2030 (/2608/General-Plan-2030)      Hilltop Horizon Specific Plan (https://hilltophorizon.com/)      Historical Point Molate Project Information (http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/270/Point-Molate)      Mapping Services (/3344/Mapping-Services)      Printable Maps (/290)      Project Information (/2860/Project-Information)       Additional Projects      Environmental Documents      General Plan Updates       About -

The project partners will host a design charrette to develop ideas for the play street, & then work with artists, local non-profits, & volunteers to implement the improvements.  Project partners will select 1-2 Lead Artists with public art & community engagement experience from the RAC's roster of experienced teaching artists. Through RAC's Artists in Schools & Arts in the Community Program, the partners will work with two local elementary schools & youth of the Nevin Community Center to develop and implement portions of the project. In addition to the work done by K-6th grade students in after school programs, the project lead artists will hold 3-4 community work days in which community members & families of student artists can help install the fence art work & complete the asphalt painting.  The improvements contemplated include games painted on the ground, a game that will be displayed as fence art, stepping stones for balancing, blackboards for drawing, boulders for seating, community garden boxes with seating areas & interactive educational signs about the green features of the alley, nutrition, and healthy living. Other improvements include a trash & recycling receptacle, a safety barrier that can be closed when families are playing, & gateway fencing for the play street. The themes of the games will focus on sustainability, nutrition, & healthy living. The games & signage proposed will be in English and Spanish to encourage use of this play street by non-English speaking area residents. Prior to the green alley improvements, this alley was a source of blight for this community. This project will make play a priority in the alley versus vehicle travel and will help create community ownership of the alley to ensure its longevity as a community asset.  The creation of an attractive neighborhood green & play space will reduce the need for vehicle trips to have opportunities for play and to be physically active in a park-deficient neighborhood. It will also encourage and support the use and enjoyment of outdoor space, enhancing the community & promoting public health.   Mathieu Court Alley Play Street Selected as One of the 50 Winners Nationwide in the Play Everywhere Challenge  Earlier this summer, the City of Richmond partnered with the Richmond Art Center, Trust for Public Land, Richmond Love Your Block Initiative, and the Iron Triangle Neighborhood Council to submit a concept to paint interactive games & artwork on Mathieu Court Alley, a recently transformed \"green alley\". The idea is to add opportunities for play where families can have a fun, green, and clean place to play within the alley in this park-deficient neighborhood. In August, this project was selected as a finalist to submit a full grant application and on Tuesday, September 20th, the project was selected as one of the 50 winners, out of the 1000 plus applications submitted nationwide. The project implementation is expected to begin in November, beginning with a design charrette with area schools and residents in October.

Working with the community to green this 16,000 square foot paved surface will promote a healthy community by reclaiming this space as a usable neighborhood amenity, and help deter undesirable activities that occur there now. Residents and community partners will not only be involved in the designing of the space, but also in the construction activities through part-time employment and volunteer opportunities.     The project will replace 16,000 square feet of impervious paving with landscaped areas, and with pervious pavers and/or turf cell where vehicle access is necessary. Incorporating bioswales and/or rain gardens, and native planting, the project will mimic natural systems that clean and filter stormwater, recharge groundwater, and create habitat for native birds and beneficial insects. It will create a new community green space with tree canopy (possibly fruit or nut trees), community garden opportunities, and landscaped informal seating areas. Community gardens and edible landscape will create a source of fresh produce in a “food desert” neighborhood. Limiting vehicle access will allow for more shared use of the entire space, with opportunities for children to play safely, as well as providing a safe route of travel.    The greening of Mathieu Court will decrease air and water pollution by filtering stormwater, mitigating runoff, and providing tree canopy. The additional tree canopy and landscape area will also reduce heat island effect, mitigating effects of climate change. The existing asphalt paving can be recycled and incorporated into underlying base material for areas of pervious paving, thus limiting consumption of natural resources. Creation of an attractive neighborhood green will reduce the need for vehicle trips to get to an open space in this park-deficient neighborhood. It will also encourage and support the use and enjoyment of outdoor space, enhancing the community and promoting public health.

The proposed improvements include construction of a new diversion box, pump station, pipeline, and an above ground, circular, pre-stressed concrete tank with storage volume of approximately 5 million gallons. The tank will be approximately 150 feet in diameter and approximately 53 feet tall. Water Pollution Control Plant effluent will be used to supply water to the wash down system used to clean the tank. The tank will be covered to contain odors. The project site is located at 601 Canal Boulevard in the City of Richmond.

The Modernization Project also includes related infrastructure improvements to Facility piping, utility lines, and electrical systems. The Modernization Project includes several integral equipment components that would reduce air emissions from Facility operations (the Emission Reduction Project Components) and further Project Design Features proposed to avoid or minimize environmental impacts. The Project also includes a new Reliability Program, including new safety programs and several physical modifications including the replacement of 17 piping circuits in the Crude Unit. Reducing Project emissions would help meet Chevron's commitment of assuring that the Project would cause no net increase in emissions of criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases, and public health risks from air pollutants, when compared to the Facility emissions and operations that occurred during the baseline period of 2008 through 2010. Following issuance of all necessary approvals, Chevron proposes to complete Project construction within approximately 24 months. The City Council approved the Modernization Project on July 29, 2014.

The school would increase student enrollment in grades 5 through 12 from approximately 800 to a maximum enrollment of 2,050, and increase the number of staff from 70 to 300. In addition to renovations to the existing three classroom buildings, the project would demolish approximately 165,387 square feet of existing one- and two-story commercial buildings on six parcels and construct three new classroom buildings and two new gymnasiums. Overall proposed development includes 208,986 gross square feet of new buildings, outdoor physical recreation areas (i.e., playing and sports fields, play structures and ball courts, recess yards), new landscaping and trees throughout the site, and associated parking and infrastructure improvements. The project also involves consolidation of the eight existing parcels that make up the site into three parcels and the abandonment of Technology Court. The new school campus would be configured with two distinct campuses to house middle and high school programs.

The project site is bound by and immediately adjacent to the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad (AT&SF) to the west, the Richmond Country Club to the east and north, and Giant Road and single-family homes to the south. The project applicant is proposing a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change to the RL-2, Single Family Low Density Residential District and OS, Open Space District, and a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (TTM) to allow the development of 94 single-family homes. The development of the proposed project would require re-configuration of a portion of the golf course and the removal of existing mature eucalyptus trees within the project site boundaries and adjacent to the golf course. The proposed single-family homes would be a mixture of 1- and 2-stories with a maximum building height of 25 feet.

At least 10 percent of the proposed new housing units would be affordable to moderate-income households. The project site is comprised of three parcels: two contiguous parcels located west of Napa Street and a separate parcel located east of Napa Street. There is existing residential development on the west side of Napa Street. This development would remain and is not part of the proposed project. The three-story townhome-style condominiums with traditional architecture would be developed in 15 buildings ranging from triplexes to eight-plexes, separated by landscaped paseos and common open space. Five floor plans would be offered. The development will also contain amenities, including a community garden, landscaping, pathways, and small open space areas throughout the site to serve the Project residents. The project would require approval of a Vesting Tentative Map, Design Review, Conditional Use Permit and Concession and waiver under State Density Bonus Law.

The Project would develop approximately 5.5 acres of the site and preserve the remaining 12.9 acres (approximately 70 percent of the site) of the 18.4 acres site as open space.  The buildings will have a height of 40-50 feet above the finished floor elevation of ground level units. Landscaping, pathways, and small open space areas would be installed throughout the site. Other planned neighborhood amenities include a recreation center, fitness center, and swimming pool. The Project also includes internal roads and infrastructure improvements. The Project may also include improvements to the existing right-of-way, including the addition of landscaping and lighting, and improvements to the San Francisco Bay Trail.  The Project includes a proposed General Plan amendment to change the land use designation of the site from Parks and Recreation to Medium Density Residential. The Project also includes a proposed change in the site’s zoning designation from Parks and Recreation (PR) to Planned Area District (PA), including exceeding the maximum building height limit of 35 feet for the Medium Density Residential General Plan designation.   Project Location The Project site is located at 1135 Canal Boulevard, south and east of the intersection of Canal Boulevard and Seacliff Drive in the neighborhood of Point Richmond, in the City of Richmond, Contra Costa County (see Figure 1 in this NOP). The Project site is bounded by Miller-Knox Regional Shoreline park (which is managed by the East Bay Regional Park District [EBRPD]) to the north, Seacliff Drive and the residential community of Seacliff to the east, vacant property and Seacliff Drive to the south, and Miller-Knox Regional Shoreline park and the community of Seacliff to the west.

Project Description   The Point Molate Mixed Use Project (Project) proposes a mixed-use community that would include the following components:  open space, adaptive re-use of the historic cottages, adaptive re-use of the historic Winehaven buildings, and residential development.   The Modified Project proposes a mixed-use community that would include the following components:   Approximately 1,260 newly constructed residential units.  Approximately 374,572 square feet of rehabilitated existing structures and 250,000 square feet of new construction for mixed-use development that could include restaurant, retail, commercial, and/or residential uses.  Approximately 10,000 square feet for an onsite joint fire and police substation and/or other community service uses.  At least 70 percent of the total above-water Project Site area (approximately 193.06 acres) would remain as open space, including recreational areas, parks, trails (including an approximately 1.5-mile portion of the San Francisco Bay Trail along the shoreline), vista overlooks, and other similar spaces that are open to the public.  A terminal on the existing pier that may be accessible to water transit options, such as ferries, water shuttles, and/or water taxis.  New roads to serve the development within the Project Site; additionally, widening Stenmark Drive from the Project Site to I-580 Ramps.  Utilities and infrastructure improvements that would be required to serve the new development.
